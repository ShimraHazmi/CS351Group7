    - What interactive things we still need to add to frontend
    - Complete backend data structures
    - Github Maintenance Steps
    - Pull request approvals
    - Thursday peer review day

Today, we discussed about finishing up the 2 pages of frontend implementation and the 2 data structures for backend. We discussed about what still needs to be added to frontend such as implementing the interactive sections.

For backend, we discussed finishing up these implementations and pushing to github. 

As for github maintenance, we need to set up pull requests whenever we want to merge to main to make sure that there are no conflicts and so that everyone can leave comments and review the merge. To do this, add everyone as reviewers.

Thursday is peer review day, so make sure to be present!
