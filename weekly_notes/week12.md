Week 12 Notes:

Meeting date: 11/9/25 5:30pm

Agenda:

    - Complete login page. Ex: Forget Password? with OAuth
    - Look more into using database if we're using OAuth for Forget Password
    - Build database to store queries
    - Consider building out the Contact Us form.
    - Implement Search Candidate frontend page: connect to backend
    - Build out the backend connections with the frontend

    Today we discussed stuff about what remaining items we still had to finish implementing and fully connecting the frontend to the backend.

    We talked about finishing up backend, implementing OAuth for login page, and implementing the Contact Us page form.

    We also talked about preparing for the presentation with the TA that will be happening online. We need to download the screen viewing software and have the slides done by our meeting time.
