## ℹ️ Overview

Young voters can stay informed without having to navigate between government websites thanks to CivicConnect, a full-stack civic data companion.  Calls to civicapi.org are coordinated by our Django API, which also caches results in SQLite and exposes clean endpoints for election timelines, ballot measures, and candidate lookups.  A Trie based autocomplete keeps searches fast even on mobile devices, and a React dashboard arranges everything into manageable tabs, from recent races and registration materials to impending election dates.  The objective is straightforward: provide communities, particularly young adults navigating a complex political environment, with a single, trustworthy source of up-to-date election information.
