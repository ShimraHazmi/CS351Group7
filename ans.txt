CS351 Project Milestone 2 Answers:

Logistics: 

Q1) Our group has mixed availabilities, but we are mostly available after 5pm everyday. Our weekly meetings are scheduled for Saturdays 5:30pm.

Q2) 
 - On our upcoming weekly meeting on 10/4: We will plan out the preliminary project details like the scope of the project, what APIs we plan on using, the target/audience of the project, and general details regarding it.
 - Every week following that, we will have a weekly meeting to check in and advance in the project. This will include things from planning to the actual implementation of the project. If we decide to split the work, then these meetings can serve as a check in on how much progress we've made, any blockers we have, or any help we need from other teammates.

Q3) a: Our group will most likely communicate through discord for sending quick text messages, but if we need to schedule a meeting to discuss things in more depth, we will set up zoom/Google Meets so that we have screen sharing capabilities.

    b: Usernames (Discord):
		- Shimra: shim.mers
		- Abrar: abbrrr
		- Hau: loops9833
		_ Duong: kyra_2604

    c: The expected time to response to messages would be within 12 hours ideally!
